SMS - Administrative and Data Visualisation Desktop site

Part 1 of the SMS Project, this site allows the user to manage and visualise the 
information collected by the mobile data collection app. 

To be of any use it needs a fairly populated database with very recent (in terms of date) data. I am working on this.

It makes extensive use of my first implementation of Ajax.
